# Election Analysis

I have assisted the Colorado Board of Election with the local election audit. My contact were Tom and his manager Seth. I used Python to write algorithms that has assist me in confirmation and analysis of election results. 

## Overview of Election Audit:

There were 369,711 votes were cast in 3 counties for 3 candidates. The largest county turnout with 82.8% was in Denver with Diana DeGette winning the local election with 272,892 votes.

## Election-Audit Summary: 

We can use this script for any other county, we just need to update the data in the CSV file.
With the help of the for loop, both in the county and candidate it will provide the result even if the number is different for county or the candidates. 
The script contains blank lists and dictionaries, allowing analyzation for other elections.
